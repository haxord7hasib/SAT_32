# ESP32 Sensor Server Project

## Description
This project involves setting up an ESP32-based server to read data from various sensors including a DHT22 for temperature and humidity, an MPU6050 for gyroscope and accelerometer readings, and a BMP085 for barometric pressure and altitude.

## Components
- ESP32
- DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Adafruit MPU6050 Gyroscope and Accelerometer
- Adafruit BMP085 Barometric Pressure Sensor

## Circuit Connections
Detail the connections as outlined above.

## Setup and Installation
1. **Arduino IDE Setup**:
   - Install the necessary libraries (`DHT sensor library`, `Adafruit MPU6050`, `Adafruit BMP085`).
   - Configure the ESP32 board on Arduino IDE.

2. **Code Upload**:
   - Connect the ESP32 to your computer.
   - Open the provided code in Arduino IDE.
   - Select the correct board and port.
   - Upload the code to ESP32.

## Accessing the Sensor Data
- Connect the ESP32 to a Wi-Fi network (details provided in the code).
- Once connected, the ESP32 will start the server and display sensor data on a web page.
- Access this data by navigating to `http://esp32.local` in a web browser.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure all connections are secure.
- Check the serial monitor for any error messages.
- Make sure the correct libraries are installed.

## Additional Notes
- The refresh rate and other parameters can be adjusted in the code.

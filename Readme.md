# ESP32 Sensor Server Project

## Description
This project sets up an ESP32-based server to collect data from various sensors: DHT22 (temperature and humidity), MPU6050 (gyroscope and accelerometer), and BMP085 (barometric pressure and altitude). The server displays this data on a web page.

## Components
- ESP32
- DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Adafruit MPU6050 Gyroscope and Accelerometer
- Adafruit BMP085 Barometric Pressure Sensor

## Circuit Connections
Below is a list of connections between the ESP32 and each sensor:

### DHT22 Sensor
- VCC to 3.3V on ESP32
- GND to GND
- DATA to GPIO 26

### Adafruit MPU6050
- VCC to 3.3V on ESP32
- GND to GND
- SDA to SDA (GPIO 21)
- SCL to SCL (GPIO 22)

### Adafruit BMP085
- VCC to 3.3V on ESP32
- GND to GND
- SDA to SDA (GPIO 21)
- SCL to SCL (GPIO 22)
